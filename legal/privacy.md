# Privacy Policy — dicom-sr-scrubber

**Last updated:** 2026-05-20.

This policy describes how César Pereiro García (the "Provider", "we") processes personal data in connection with dicom-sr-scrubber ("the Service"). It is intended to comply with Regulation (EU) 2016/679 (GDPR) and Spanish Ley Orgánica 3/2018 (LOPDGDD).

## 1. Data controller

César Pereiro García, individual professional, [SPANISH ADDRESS], NIF [TO PROVIDE]. Contact for privacy queries: cesar.pereiro.garcia@gmail.com.

No DPO has been appointed because the processing does not meet the Article 37 GDPR thresholds.

## 2. Categories of personal data processed

DICOM SR files supplied by the customer. SR ContentSequence items may contain personal and health data; the entire purpose of the tool is to scrub that data. All processing happens client-side (the OSS CLI) or in the customer's tenant of dcm-anon-vault Phase 2 (the paid add-on). The Service never receives raw DICOM files. Customer account data is processed by Stripe via the dcm-anon-vault billing flow.

We do NOT seek to process production personal data beyond what is strictly necessary for the Service to function. Where the Service's design contemplates personal-data inputs, we ask customers to provide sanitised, aggregated, or pseudonymised inputs wherever feasible. If a Customer engagement requires processing of special-category data (e.g. health data) we sign a Data Processing Agreement per Article 28 GDPR before any processing begins.

## 3. Legal bases

- **Performance of a contract** (Art. 6(1)(b) GDPR) for processing necessary to deliver the Service under the Terms of Service.
- **Legitimate interest** (Art. 6(1)(f) GDPR) for processing that improves Service reliability and security.
- **Legal obligation** (Art. 6(1)(c) GDPR) for accounting records retained per Spanish tax law (6 years).
- **Consent** (Art. 6(1)(a) GDPR) for any marketing communications, withdrawable at any time.

## 4. Recipients

We do not sell or rent personal data. Categories of recipients:

(a) **Stripe Payments Europe Limited** (Ireland): payment processing for paid tiers.
(b) **Wise Europe SA** (Belgium): bank transfer rails for invoiced engagements.
(c) **GitHub, Inc.** / **GitHub Sponsors**: applicable where the Service uses GitHub-hosted billing during interim periods.
(d) **Buttondown** (USA, GDPR-compliant): newsletter delivery, where applicable.
(e) **Google LLC / Google Ireland**: Gmail for business correspondence, Standard Contractual Clauses apply.
(f) **Spanish tax authority (AEAT)**: for invoicing and tax records when legally required.
(g) **Professional advisors** (accountant, lawyer) under confidentiality, need-to-know.

No marketing-driven transfers. No automated decision-making producing legal effects.

## 5. International transfers

Transfers to processors operating outside the EEA occur under EU adequacy mechanisms or Standard Contractual Clauses approved by the European Commission.

## 6. Retention

- **Account and billing records:** duration of the subscription plus 6 years for Spanish tax compliance, then deleted.
- **Customer-supplied inputs for hosted-tier processing:** processed in-memory and not persisted beyond the run, except where the tier description explicitly states otherwise; in those cases, retained no longer than 30 days unless the Customer pins them.
- **Marketing contact data (consent-based):** retained until consent is withdrawn or 3 years of inactivity, whichever is sooner.

## 7. Data subject rights

Under GDPR you have the right to: (a) Access (Art. 15), (b) Rectification (Art. 16), (c) Erasure (Art. 17), (d) Restriction (Art. 18), (e) Portability (Art. 20), (f) Objection (Art. 21), (g) Withdraw consent (Art. 7(3)), (h) Lodge a complaint with the Spanish supervisory authority (AEPD, www.aepd.es) or your local EU supervisory authority.
